/// @brief The canvaslist file contains declarations for the CanvasList
///     class that is a linked list class that mimics the drawing of 
///     shapes to a screen or space. For our simplified drawing we do
///     not use GUI but each shape in the list will output its details to
///     the console when draw is called. Initial file authored by:
